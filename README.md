## About Us

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back.
It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive.
Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig economy workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And weâ€™re only just getting started.

## Our Values

Zego is thoroughly committed to our values, which are the essence of our culture. Our values defined everything we do and how we do it.
They are the foundation of our company and the guiding principles for our employees. Our values are:
